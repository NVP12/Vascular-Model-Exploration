# ðŸ§  Vascular Model Exploration in MuJoCo

This repository contains the simulation framework developed as part of the **RPM Lab Programming Challenge** (University of Minnesota, Fall 2025 intake). The goal is to simulate navigation through human vascular structures using a dynamic camera (representing a catheter tip) inside the MuJoCo physics engine.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To create an interactive MuJoCo simulation that enables:
- Loading and visualizing STL-based 3D vascular models.
- Manual navigation through the vasculature using keyboard inputs.
- Dual-view rendering: one for external/global view and another from the first-person cameraâ€™s point-of-view inside the vessels.

This project aims to demonstrate visual understanding and simulation capabilities for robotic navigation in medical environments.

## ðŸ§© Features

- âœ… Loads and scales STL files of neurovascular structures.
- âœ… Supports mesh downsampling for rendering efficiency.
- âœ… Implements a controllable "camera drone" that mimics catheter navigation.
- âœ… Renders two windows:
  - **Global View** â€“ static camera to track the navigation inside vessels.
  - **FPV (First-Person View)** â€“ immersive view from inside the vessels.
- âœ… Demonstrated on multiple anatomical models.
